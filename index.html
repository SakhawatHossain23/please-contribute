                        of educational institutions have either been closed, or submerged by the devastating floods –

                After a devastating flood in early June that affected around 4 million residents, the same area was hit
                again with record-breaking rainfall that began on June 15. Most of the Sylhet city has gone underwater
                again, with water continuing to rise, worsening the condition of those still living in temporary
                shelters and further exposed to extreme weather and waterborne diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Up to this date, the flood has affected nearly 7 millions people throughout Bangladesh-worst-flood-hit
                areas.

                Friendship fears that if the crisis continues for more than two weeks, the resulting loss of daily
                earnings, coupled with the lost crops, is certain to cause a food crisis. Fodder for livestock and
                nutrition for children will also present a major challenge.
